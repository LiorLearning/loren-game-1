# Completed Tasks

- ✅ Base upgrades - Already implemented in base.js with upgradeBase() method
- ✅ Another way to collect ammo is to go to the right side and collect the ammo boxes (where the enemy dies). These ammo boxes are now created when enemies are defeated.
- ✅ If the base is at level 4, and the user is having mech and is defeated the wave of enemies, then transition to the next stage, change the background to ./assets/background2.png, and give user a ship ./assets/user-ship.png. (Note: user-ship.png asset was not found in assets folder)
